# URL-Minimiser
A spring boot java service, to minimize URLs, cache them, and related operations
</br>
This application allows the creation of unique short URLs, as well as provides mapping and statistics against them. Short links have the size of one-third or even one-fourth of the original URL, which makes them easier to type, present, or tweet. Clicking on a short link will raise a request, and the user can be automatically redirected to the original URL.
